# NullObject[![travis-ci](https://secure.travis-ci.org/martinciu/nullobject.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/martinciu/nullobject)
### Intent

The intent of a Null Object is to encapsulate the absence of an object by providing a substitutable alternative that offers suitable default do nothing behavior. In short, a design where “nothing will come of nothing”

## Setup

If you are using bundler add nullobject to your Gemfile:

    gem 'nullobject'

Then run:

    bundle install

Otherwise install the gem:

    gem install nullobject

and require it in your project:

    require 'nullobject'

## Usage

[TODO]

## Development

Source hosted at [GitHub](http://github.com/martinciu/nullobject).
Report Issues/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/martinciu/nullobject/issues).

Tests can be ran with `rake test`

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests

 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
   future version unintentionally.
 * Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
   (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
 * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
